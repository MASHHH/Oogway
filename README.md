We have trained a dataset of conversations and sentiments on Wit.ai and we are using Discord as the platform to host our bot. \
Our bot is maintaining records of users to assess their mental health status in real-time and it is providing comfort to the users as the bot mimics a companion. \
We have employed web-parsing for the audio-visual responses for the user which will be sent by the bot at different intervals depending on the mood of the user.

Our bot was made using the following dependencies. 
  - ```pip install pywit```
  - ```pip install discord.py```
  - ```pip install quickchart.io```
  - ```pip install beautifulsoup4```
  - ```pip install lxml```
  - ```pip install urllib3```
