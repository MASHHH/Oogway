You are doing the best you can!", 'Life is full of opportunities', 'Fear eats all logic. DO NOT let it get to you. I believe in you!' ], 
 'conversation':["Let us distract you. Tell me your favourite food and why do you like it so much?", 'Why do you think that way? Is there a particular reason that makes you think that?',  'We can not be good with everything. Believe in yourself and keep improving.', 'I believe in you',  'You brighten up every room you walk into.', 'There is really no limit to the amount of happiness you can experience, as long as you keep it your intent to feel happy each day.

You have come so far, keep going!', 'If you believe that whatever is happening is for your best interests, you will have a much better mindset and be able to handle those problems better.

Belief is a powerful ally, and once you have it you are pretty much guaranteed that things will work out.', "Do not worry what other people think. Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud.", 'View challenges as opportunities — This is how we improve as a person because life has constant challenges every day.

Never let that stop you.', 'Never fear failure — My biggest failures have always been the most life-changing. People like J.K.

You will soon find a solution.', 'Just because problems present themselves does not mean you have to let them get you down. Instead of wishing your problems away you can simply wish to be able to deal with your problems in a way that does not impede on your happiness.
